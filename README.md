# Kurikaesu Worm ðŸª±

This malware replicates itself and makes unwanted files that consume spaces in our hard drives or the current directory and sub-directories.
It will make your drives/directory full without any visible reason and even freeze your system too.

shutil module helps in automating the process of copying and removal of files and directories

```
pip install pytest-shutil
import random
```
